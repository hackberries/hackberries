      We got this. We work with Rails for more than 8 years. Some applications
      we maintain are older than 14. Released before Rails 1.0! We find joy
      in keeping a useful system in a good shape.

        I have a slow Rails application and want to make it faster.

      This happens. There's often not enough time to invest in performance. But
      performance matters. We use solid, industry standard tools to find
      performance bottlenecks in your application. Low hanging fruits and high
      benefits first!

      We would be happy to help! We <strong>always</strong> write tests and we
      love when other teams take effort to do so. We can help your team start
      with testing and Test Driven Development. We can write core tests for
      existing apps, fix flaky tests, optimize test suites and set up a
      Continuous Integration pipeline for your project.

      Is it on the Web? We can probably do it. We helped our clients automate
      workflows, launch static and WordPress websites, implement designs
      and WordPress themes. Even if it's not our core expertise, if you're our
      client, we'll help any way we can.
